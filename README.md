# ExcelToDb

If you have one excel sheet. How would you convert data from a sheet into a table in Database.

Constraints - Code/solution should be reusable i.e. today table is user, after 10 days I might want to upload data from Customer Table and later from Employees.
As long as Column names are matched between Excel and Db... It should Convert data .
Order of Columns should not be important.
Data Types match between Db and Excel should be bit flexible.
